`Veloren` is an **Open Source** game. I want to learn about what a complete large-scale game looks like by studying this project. In the end, I hope to achieve the following goals:
1. The infrastructure of a large-scale game. What would it look like if we were to simplify it?
2. Since the project itself is written in Rust, what are the distinguishing features of the Rust language compared to other languages?
3. If we were to replace Rust with another language, such as Golang or C++, how would that be done?
